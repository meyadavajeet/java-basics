/*Polymorphism is a combination of two words-
 * poly - means Many
 * Morphs - means Forms
 * def- Methods having same name with different argument is known as polymorphism
 *  Types of polymorphism-
 *  1. Compile Time Polymorphism - (Static Binding)
 *  2. Run Time Polymorphism - (Dynamic Binding)
 *
 *  1. Compile time polymorphism - It executes while method  overloading
 * m1(int i); - first method
 * m2(double d); - second method
 * It will decide compiler the argument provided by the user then the function executes.
 *
 * 2. Run time polymorphism - It executes while method overriding
 * Parent
 *  m1()
 * child
 * m1()
 * Here compiler confuse which method it should execute for the perfect execution then runtime time
 *  polymorphism occurs to overcome this situation.
